  "date":  "17 June 2025",
  "description": "After a short break over the weekend, investors have started to digest what AMD unveiled in last week's AI event coupled with a hint at a de-escalation in the Middle East. AMD is positioned very well to capitalize on the next wave of data center growth revenue as more and more companies tune in to the AI race by expanding their processing capacity. AMD's strategic partnership with Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, OpenAI and xAI (including a possible AWS partnership) also allows it to benefit from the ecosystem of AI frontrunners. I have been championing this stock since the start of the year and I'm planning to hold it until it reaches the range of $150-$175. In my opinion, AMD will hit $135 easily before August should there be no geopolitical disruption."

  "date":  "13 June 2025",
  "description": "The fear is overblown in my opinion, the duopoly of Visa and Mastercard is so entrenched in the payments sector that they will not disappear without a huge catalyst. Even as many countries roll out their own digital payments service, the credit cards from Visa and Mastercard are still widely used because of the seamless transaction experience of swapping a card or tapping your phone. Beyond that, the economies of scale of Visa and Mastercard allow card holders to redeem perks like airport lounge access or flight redemption. On the other hand, I think this move will greatly affect Paypal's underlying business because unlike payment giants like Visa and Mastercard, Paypal hasn't reached that level of reputation and it is a hassle to go through their customer service and account resolution speaking as a Paypal user myself."

  "date": "6 June 2025",
  "description": "Elon Musk who has stepped away from DOGE as a special government employee recently criticized the restoration of tax cuts proposed by Trump in the Big Beautiful Bill after the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts. No doubt this will increase the short term US fiscal spending and enlarge the deficit. This effect in turn will cause record levels of national debt and naturally a higher interest payment as investors' fear of the irresponsible, uncontrolled spending kicks in. Many speculate that Musk is bitter about leaving DOGE and Trump taking away his EV mandates which provides EV incentives to EV car buyers. Where the $1.6T in savings comes from nobody knows. One thing that is more probable is a spending deficit. Aside from tax cuts, the bill also includes cost-cutting measures like new Medicaid work requirements and the cancellation of food stamps. However the $1.2T in spending cuts is not enough to offset the $3.7T in lost revenue over the next decade. The concept of trickle-down economic cuts to stimulate economic growth has been around since the Reagan era. The idealistic idea of allowing the rich to keep more money so that they will expand their businesses and hire more workers thereby pushing the economy forward is not exactly clear cut. As we know, the average propenstiy to save increase with income, so the wealthy are less likely to spend the extra income from tax cuts. Even when they invest that money, there’s no guarantee it stays in the U.S. They can outsource jobs, invest in foreign markets, or park money in offshore accounts, none of which helps American workers. All it does is just making the rich wealthier and the inequality gap wider. And a very wide inequality gap is always an indication to a country's decay."

Surprisingly, both DLTR and DG stocks have been holding up quite well being up 24% and 43% year-to-date respectively.

  "date": "19 May 2025",
  "description": "1: The stock market overreacts to good or bad news sometimes causing the stock price to be temporarily too high or too low. These temporary excesses create profitable opportunities for a contrarion strategy of buying what others are selling and selling what others are buying. 2: Companies with the most optimistic forecast may be likely to be overly optimistic than excessively pessimistic and will probably not do so well. Similarly, most pessimistic predictions are likely to be too pessimistic and they're more likely to beat the gloomy predictions. Pessimistic portfolios are more likely to trounce the optimistic portfolio. Gary Smith concludes that the markets do miss the $100 bill laying on the sidewalk. 3: Deleted stocks from the Dow may outperform stocks that replace them over a 10 year subsequent period when compared to the S&P500 due to regression to the mean. Sometimes when a stock is added to the Dow, its stock performance may be superb causing PE ratio to be excessively high and its stock price highly inflated. Even for companies with good moat and fundamentals, at one point the price will be too high and the same applies to deleted stocks, there is going to be a price so low that it becomes attractive. And this is why the deleted stocks over outperform because the high growth experienced by the added stocks may be attributed to luck and good luck rarely repeats. Having said this, it is highly impractical and borderline dangerous to expect NVIDIA to continue on its 40% plus annual growth rate for the next 10 years. In conclusion for stocks, a contrarion strategy can be employed—avoiding companies that have done well or are predicted to do well and investing in out-of-favour stocks. In the same way, stocks that drop sharply are often better investments than are stocks that surge, and stocks that are removed from the Dow are generally better investments than the stocks that replace them. This is counterintuitive for most investors, which leaves $100 bills on the sidewalk for those who understand regression."

  "description": "AMD recently announced a board approved $6B in stock buyback signalling to investors that they are fairly optimistic on the company's growth trajectory for future. Do I personally like this buyback? No even though it benefits my call option. I would prefer they spend this capital on ramping up production to solve the supply shortage of their recently released GPUs RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. However, this may not necessarily be a bad move for them to raise capital in the future as the stock appreciates due to its cheap stock price right now. And we can see with NVIDIA's August 2023 $25B buyback announcement they bought it for cheap right before the 2024 NVIDIA stock price sprint. $6B is a conservative figure in AMD's terms and I am satisfied with the way the management is maneuvering around this uncertain time. According to my DCF model, if we expect AMD's compound annual growth rate to be at 43% (similar to the period of 2019-2024) then with a discout rate of 15% we get its estimated intrinsic value to be $198."

The way I see Google is that it is in the same position that Meta was in back in 2022. Many people speculated that Instagram was dead as waves of tiktok adoption soar in the US. Meta's stock was seen as dirt and it's stock price was heavily discounted and undervalued at about $99 at its lowest. Since then it has moved upwards by 550% in a span of 3 years. Right now Google is in the same disposition. 'LLMs will kill Google Search'; 'Anti-Trust Monopoly Lawsuits will cause Google to break and be susceptible to attacks by competitors'. There has never been a better time to buy Google shares if you are in it for the long term because though there will be more pain in the near term, I highly believe that they will emerge the same as Meta. Other than Search, they have YouTube, Waymo, Google Cloud, Google Workspace, Google Maps and a platform to discover restaurants and bars (though this area has also been contested by the better reccomendation algorithm that Little Red Note has). Google is not going anywhere soon but before you enjoy the profits from Google stocks probable appreciation, you will need to be able to stomach the stock trading sideways and its divisions getting broken up."

Now that there will be lesser demand for the Yuan as the demand for Chinese exports decrease, the Chinese government has to choose which strategy they want to employ. Do nothing and the Yuan will weaken leading to more internal inflation and possibly some macroeconomic complications for the Chinese economy.

  "date": "11 Apr 2025",
  "description": "The last time we mentioned that one of the scenarios this tariff situation will pan out is that the US will remove its own tariffs if others come to the negotiating table. Even though the US merely suspended the tariffs (once again...) the two basically mean the same. Now with the US-China trade war ramping up, I believe the US will need to get as many allies on its side and prevent them from feeling alienated which will make them lean over to China. Therefore, it is highly likely that the Trump administration will employ a softer stance on trade deficits with other countries. Furthermore the revenue from tariffs are not even enough to cover the huge piling debt that the US faces. There are only a few ways that the US can increase its revenue quickly and effective and one of them is the good old income taxes. Although Trump promised against this during his campaign, it is the only quickest and most efficient way of raising money. Laying off employees like a startup does not work in bureaucratic governmental institutions. Therefore, it is probable that Trump will raise taxes on the rich and increase capital gains tax. But many will ask won't Trump's friends get angry? That is where the effects of uncertainty of tariffs come in. With these huge swings and dips in the market, I believe Trump has prompted all his rich friends on when it's the right time to buy or sell so that they can make billions from the working class who are buying high and selling low in a panic. Then after all his friends have earned a significant wealth gain will he introduce the new income taxes on the richest. That way, the wealth of the richest has not changed, while the working class suffer without knowing what happened because on the surface Trump merely taxed the rich but in actuality there has been a transfer of wealth from the working class to the rich going on in the stock market."

Never forget the power of Reactive Adaptation where after a huge period of discomfort someone will step in to correct the situation as we have seen with Dollar Tree’s pivot and the appointment of Intel’s new CEO. When things tend to go bad, an actor usually the most affected will step in. For example, when stocks fall so much to the point that people are worried about their 401Ks they will come out to protest their leadership. This is just one example of Reactive Adaption. Buy the dip or catch the falling knife is inherently uncertain. By the time you get indication that the macroeconomic conditions are going well, it would already have been instantaneously priced into the market which is why always buy when you think it’s going bad because once it recovers it is hard to get on the train.

  "date": "04 Apr 2025",
  "description": "After Trump’s rollout of the worldwide reciprocal tariffs on many countries stocks fell in many regions. In the US the VIX shot up to 30.52 indicating major fear and uncertainty in the market. Almost every stock is down about 10% or more, the hardest hit ones are the chips and tech stocks. A few scenarios this can pan out: First, the tariffs get placed and affected countries retaliate, the US market goes into a stagflation territory where the Feds cannot reduce the rates any further but cannot increase it either due to slowing economic activity and struggling businesses. Second, some countries might see it as unnecessary pain and remove their own tariffs to prompt the US to remove theirs too. Third, I believe many politicians congress and representatives alike own shares and as much as they love their country I believe as true Americans they love their money even more. Therefore, it is not off the table for congress to pass a bipartisan bill to either take over the executive control of tariffs or revoke it. Four, this may be an elaborate scheme Trump informed his wealthy friends before hand that he would cause chaos in the market and they should buy up before he reverses course which makes it a legal transfer of wealth from the working class Americans who sold in a panic. As much as we think the market is in utmost fear, we have to also remember that Trump has made TSMC and others including Saudi Arabia sign an investment pledge in the US in the coming years, building fabs and factories locally. Last but not least, we cannot forget the impeachment which is a possibility if republicans think enough is enough. Overall, even though Trump’s tariffs might not raise as much as expected, it is still a widely popular policy in place of direct taxation which like in the UK’s case we have seen how inaction leads to worsening economic conditions and a compounding difficult and harsh reality ahead to pay off their national debt. Before this recession and tariffs, many analysts were worried about the rising US national debt and ever increasing interest payments. However, now that Trump has outlined exactly how his administration will obtain more money to reduce the spending deficit the national debt question has to been traded in for a short term recessionary one. Despite Trumps choices the current economic landscape is not a bright one to be in. It’s going to be tough decisions after tough decisions."

However, when you look at factors supporting its valuation you see their Epyc CPUs which are highly favoured in data centers over Intel CPUs furthermore every 10 GPU needs a CPU (rough estimate here). If their data center revenue fell short this quarter its good news that they still have ceiling to grow the next quarter.

	"description": "Only managed $600 from this stock boost as I sold my LEAP last friday. Do i regret my decision? no. Is there anything to be learned from this? yes. IV crush does not affect LEAP that still has 6 months that significantly. LEAP rose from 3.2k to 4.9k about 50% increase while the underlying stock only rose 25%. One thing i learned is to use the factors of earnings: 1) expectation, 2) surprise, 3) outlook, 4) company restructure (CEO step down?), 5) use news report leading up to earnings (newly formed gov contracts)"

	"description": "DLTR dropped 7% back to $68 just $1 below my intrinsic calc of $69 last year proving my analysis to be quite spot on, also stocks are falling all across the board except for VISA. TSLA and NVDA odwn 4% due to export controls and tariffs… Cash position is largest at $5700 on lynns account perfect opportunity to do stock sweep purchasing. Thankfully i liquidated my PLTR option as PLTR came back to $80 level from $84, i have so do some purchasing today or the opportunity cost would be burned. SOFI at $15.02 but i have designated LZ account to purchase it lower with $400 budget so we will monitor that, in the meantime not buying APP/PLTR due to them being too close to earnings call. PLTR is today and APP is next week 13th Feb."

	"description": "Even my mom and dad has heard about this latest R1 model which means their prevalence is picking up steam. Investors are rightful to be concerned as the training of this model only costs $5.6 million wildly under the cost OpenAI undertook to develop Chatgpt o1 model. Furthermore, DeepSeek proved that efficiency of the code is more important than the powerfulness of the GPUs you train the model on. Even with chip export restrictions from the US, DeepSeek still managed to train such a superb model although it’s an open secret that DeepSeek definitely has some high end GPUs bypassing the export curb by acquiring them from third party sellers. The AI race has officially entered main stage. Even though chip stocks are falling because of this, they stand to gain from it too as the competition will just grow fiercer and demand for high end GPUs will accelerate. Just because a Honda is fuel efficient and can get you from point A to point B does not mean people will stop seeking the Porsche that can get you there faster albeit it consumes more fuel."
