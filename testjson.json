Netted about $2000 from this whole appreciation. My view is that this stock is similar to Netflix their user base is around the same size at 300 million so I will not sell a single share and keep holding till it reaches 90% of NFLX market cap of $443B now. Sold off some PLTR few days ago because PLTR is really starting to get tricky but unlike APP i’m super behind this stock and I’m optimistic"

    "date": "10 Feb 2025",
	"description": "Although AMD is only rated 9 ish in my system, my DCF tells me its valuation should be at $175 not $109 plenty upside after speculators’ fear dumping. Few things to note here: yes it is a volatile chip stock subject to administration policies and China-Taiwan geopolitical tension as AMD still relies heavily on TSMC for the production for its chips. However, when you look at factors supporting its valuation you see their Epyc CPUs which are highly favoured in data centers over Intel CPUs furthermore every 10 GPU needs a CPU (rough estimate here). If their data center revenue fell short this quarter its good news that they still have ceiling to grow the next quarter. I will keep doing Poor Man’s Covered Calls at $135 for June 2025 and I believe we might see upwards movement in either March like it did last year (when it skyrocketed to $210) or late 2025 which I’ll then roll my LEAPs to a later date. One more point about AMD options is that in the past whenever IV is low the price is bound to have large movements over the next few months."

IV crush does not affect LEAP that still has 6 months that significantly. LEAP rose from 3.2k to 4.9k about 50% increase while the underlying stock only rose 25%. One thing i learned is to use the factors of earnings: 1) expectation, 2) surprise, 3) outlook, 4) company restructure (CEO step down?), 5) use news report leading up to earnings (newly formed gov contracts)"

Thankfully i liquidated my PLTR option as PLTR came back to $80 level from $84, i have so do some purchasing today or the opportunity cost would be burned. SOFI at $15.02 but i have designated LZ account to purchase it lower with $400 budget so we will monitor that, in the meantime not buying APP/PLTR due to them being too close to earnings call.

	"description": "Even my mom and dad has heard about this latest R1 model which means their prevalence is picking up steam. Investors are rightful to be concerned as the training of this model only costs $5.6 million wildly under the cost OpenAI undertook to develop Chatgpt o1 model. Furthermore, DeepSeek proved that efficiency of the code is more important than the powerfulness of the GPUs you train the model on. Even with chip export restrictions from the US, DeepSeek still managed to train such a superb model although it’s an open secret that DeepSeek definitely has some high end GPUs bypassing the export curb by acquiring them from third party sellers. The AI race has officially entered main stage. Even though chip stocks are falling because of this, they stand to gain from it too as the competition will just grow fiercer and demand for high end GPUs will accelerate. Just because a Honda is fuel efficient and can get you from point A to point B does not mean people will stop seeking the Porsche that can get you there faster albeit it consumes more fuel."
